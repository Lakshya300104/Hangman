# Hangman
The famous Hangman Game.
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. 
One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.
Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.
This provides you the coded version of the hangman. You would need python to play thi game.
i have added two Hangman games in this.
For the first one, Hangman, you would also need the file named word to run the game.
The second one is a stand alone program and will work without any other source file.
